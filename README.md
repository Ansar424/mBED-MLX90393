# mBED-MLX90393
The MLX90393 is based on the Hall-effect and the patented TriaxisÂ® technology from Melexis. The output signals (raw X, Y, Z Magnetic data and Temperature data) will be provided through the I2C fast mode protocol, or via halfduplex SPI (3- or 4-wire). There is an on-board non-volatile memory to store calibration data on-chip.
